What is Anime Frost?
====================

Anime Frost is a new website, continuation of Animesetsu project, designed to watch Anime stream in High Quality without problems. We had to do this change due to some staff changes. Some of our ex members are now heading towards other projects.

So, what about Animesetsu? Why did you had to change the name?
==============================================================

Animesetsu website is now closed, and AnimeFrost will take its place. We couldn’t use the name anymore because the staff member that left is the owner of the name.

I'm having issues using your web player. Can you help me?
=========================================================

Please login on YouTube if you are having issues. Our player uses YouTube API, and generally most problems are fixed if you are logged in into your Google Account. 

What about mobile?
==================

Our website currently supports HTML5 player and mobile support. While it’s not perfect, you can use it without worries. On Android, we recommend using Google Chrome. We are still allocating group resources on developing a full featured App, but the project is slow and may not come soon.


Player is showing the message: 'No preview', heading me to a download button. What can i do?
============================================================================================

Please wait some minutes before the episode is processed so the stream is processed. If you wish, you can download the episode to watch it faster, or just wait.


A episode is missing or there's a problem.
